       section. if you can solve that make commit in that issue that you can solve 
       ( like : I think I can help in this issue.
        @maintainer, I would really appreciate it if you could assign me this issue with Hacktoberfest tag so that can I can start contributing to this repo.
        Thank you and have a great Hacktoberfest.)

2. Once you have chosen the path, **make sure that the algorithm is not already implemented**. This step is very important because we dont't want your time and             energy to be go in bin.

3. When you complete step 2, read the [style guides](https://github.com/tanuj1811/damn_dsa/blob/main/coding_styles.md) or you can copy the format and edit it there.          
 

So what are you waiting for? Go on and start contributing! :smile: May the code be with you :metal:

## Get Quotent and Remainder for power of 2 e.g-2,4,8,16,... 
Hey everyone!! as we all know playing with bit-manupulation is like magic. Today i learn about one of the magic i.e
If we divide anything with power of 2 (e.g :- 2,4,8,16,32....) we can calcuate remainder and quotent in 1s.
Lemme tell u how ? 

1st : for e.g => n=15 (1111) <br/>
15/2 = 7(quotent), 1(remainder)<br/>

//-arly for 8,32,64,128


## Multiply any number with power of 2
we can double any number by right shifting 
e.g
15<<1 = 30

### Logic

in this we are multiplying every bit by 2^1 So, its beacome double

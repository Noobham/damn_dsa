## Quadratic Equation Key Points

General equation : ax<sup>2</sup> + bx +c

1. Max contains 2 roots
2. All roots depands upon discrident i.e D= b<sup>2</sup>-4ac
```
  if(D < 0) imaginory roots are there
  else if(D> 0) 2 distinct roots are there
  else(D==0) 2 equals are there
 ```
3. Roots are calcuated by method
  a. by formula : (-b ± √ (b² - 4ac) )/2a 
  b. Hit and Trial
